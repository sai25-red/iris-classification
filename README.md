Iris Classification Project

Project Overview

This project aims to develop a classification model to identify Iris flowers into three species using machine learning. The dataset includes sepal and petal length/width measurements for different species. The goal is to determine the most significant features influencing classification and evaluate the model's performance using appropriate techniques.

Installation and Setup

1.Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Iris-Classification.git
cd Iris-Classification
2.Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
3.Run the classification model:
python main.py

Data Preprocessing

1.Handled missing values and outliers.

2.Encoded categorical labels using LabelEncoder.

3.Split dataset into training and testing sets.

Model Selection

1.Implemented a Random Forest Classifier.

2.Selected optimal hyperparameters.

Model Evaluation

1.Accuracy Score: Evaluated model performance.

2.Confusion Matrix: Visualized classification results.

3.Feature Importance: Identified significant features.

4.Cross-Validation: Ensured model robustness.

Results

1.The trained model achieved high accuracy in classifying Iris species.
